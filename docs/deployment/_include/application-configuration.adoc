Kyso has different configuration options that can fit into your needs. This documentation describes what are those options and how to configure them properly.

These properties are stored in _MongoDB_ in the collection _KysoSettings_, which is basically a key-value list.

== 3rd party authentication providers

Kyso can be configured to manage different authentication providers, specifically:

. Internal Kyso authentication system
. Google
. Github
. Bitbucket
. Gitlab
. PingID SAML
. OKTA SAML


You can enable *any provider you want, in any combination*. For Kyso, the unique user identificator is the email, so as far as a user uses the same email in every provider, for Kyso it is the same user.

=== Internal Kyso authentication system

Kyso's internal authentication system is **enabled** by default, and doesn't require any specific configuration.

You can **disable it** by changing the property key `AUTH_ENABLE_GLOBALLY_KYSO` to **false** at the collection `KysoSettings`

=== Google

[NOTE]
======
You need to configure beforehand the Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID in https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials[Google Console]
